# QA-Portofolio
Quality Assurance portofolio showcasing testcases, API endpoint test, automation script

Hello, my name is Thoriq, I hold a bachelor’s degree in Economics, which has provided me with a solid foundation in analytical thinking and problem-solving.

My professional journey began in marketing, where I spent a year developing campaigns and understanding customer needs. This experience honed my communication skills and taught me the importance of aligning product quality with customer expectations.

After that, I transitioned into technical support for two years. In this role, I not only resolved technical issues but also gained a deeper understanding of the product lifecycle and the importance of user experience. This hands-on experience helped me appreciate the nuances of product functionality and how they impact users.

Most recently, I spent two years as a quality assurance professional. Here, I’ve been able to leverage my previous experiences to ensure that our products meet the highest standards. I’ve implemented testing protocols, collaborated closely with development teams, and advocated for user-centric improvements.

Overall, my background in Economics, combined with my diverse experience in marketing, technical support, and quality assurance, allows me to bridge the gap between customer insights, technical functionality, and quality assurance.
